Q: What is a data pack?

A: A pack of data. :)

Data packs were introduced in Minecraft snapshot version 17w43a, a pre-release for version 1.13.
It was a new and simplier way of allowing players to customize and edit Minecraft's default settings and..., data. :)

Data packs do not contain java files and require no special apps to create or edit files. A simple word editing app like Notepad will work or the fancier Notepad++ can be used.

Most of the files inside data packs will be easy to read json files which contain data for just about everything in the game and for the game. 

Also, custom mcfunction files, which in many cases are even easier to read than json files, will be present most of the time.

Custom structure nbt files can be used in data packs as well.
