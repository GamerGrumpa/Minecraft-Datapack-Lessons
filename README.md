# Minecraft-Datapack-Lessons

While trying to learn how to make Minecraft Data Packs, I would write myself notes so that when I forget things, I can just go back and read my notes to re-educate myself. In order for my notes to work for me, they are detailed as if I am writing them for others to read and learn. They are also written in simple terms for my simple mind to understand.

I have always been told that I am a good teacher and it is something I enjoy doing. So if I am good at teaching, why waste this talent? And if I enjoy teaching, then why not teach?

So that is simply what this is all about. Me sharing my notes so that others may learn what I have learned. Also to learn from others who find errors with my works and feel the need to correct me.

If you find value in what I have done here and believe others too may benifit from it, I simply ask you to share the github links.
